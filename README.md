Carpet Weaving Factory Management System
-----------------------------------------
Welcome to the Algorithm Design Course Project for the University of Isfahan! In this project, we will be creating a comprehensive management system for a carpet weaving factory. The aim of this project is to showcase the application of various algorithms that we have learned throughout the semester in solving real-world problems.
Project Overview
-----------------------------------------
The project focuses on designing a system that efficiently manages the operations of a carpet weaving factory. The factory consists of different departments, including design, sales, distribution, and more. We will be applying a range of algorithms to solve specific challenges within each department, demonstrating their practical use and effectiveness.
Departments and Algorithms

    Design Department:
        Utilize color algorithms to optimize the color selection process for carpets, ensuring aesthetically pleasing and harmonious designs.

    Sales Department:
        Apply sorting and searching algorithms to manage inventory and locate specific carpet designs quickly based on customer requests.

    Distribution Department:
        Implement graph algorithms (Dijkstra and Floyd) to optimize the delivery routes for carpets to various regions, minimizing transportation costs and time.

    Inventory Management:
        Use the backpack algorithm to determine the most profitable combination of carpet designs to include in the inventory, considering factors such as demand and production costs.

Getting Started
-----------------------------------------
